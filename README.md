###### TODO:

- Critical: Submit game bad user input handling
- Critical, backend: Fix access rules
- Critical, design: Make register account page
- Critical: register account functionality (should also add data to database, backend?)

- Backend: Connect login data to username data (Or should we?)
- Look at caching players locally to save downloaded data (currently loading from main.js)
- ~~Make submit game page (see submit.html)~~
- ~~Backend: Make submitGame() update player rating.~~
- ~~Add submit game functionality~~
- ~~Design: User profile page (https://dribbble.com/shots/3311782-Dark-Gamer-Profile-Design)~~
- ~~Fix url variables for profile pages~~
- ~~Fix search (should go to http://localhost/profile.html?id=search)~~
